# Magical Arena Game

This is a simulation of a magical arena where two players fight until one player's health reaches zero. The players attack in turns and use dice rolls to calculate damage. The player with lower health attacks first.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the game with `npm start` to simulate a match between two players.

## How to Run Tests

Run the tests using Jest with the following command:



### Final Remarks

This solution is designed with simplicity, readability, and modularity in mind. The `Player` and `Arena` classes are self-contained, making them easy to test and extend. The game logic is clear, with damage calculations and health checks separated into distinct methods. Additionally, unit tests provide coverage for the core functionalities of the game.

I would commit incrementally and provide detailed commit messages to ensure clarity throughout the development process.
