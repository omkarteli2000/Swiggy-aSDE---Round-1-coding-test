Design

- The `Player` class defines attributes like health, strength, and attack, and contains methods for attacking, defending, and taking damage.
- The `Arena` class manages the match, including determining the turn order and checking for the end of the game.

 Example

To simulate a match, create two `Player` objects and pass them to the `Arena` class:

```javascript
const playerA = new Player(50, 5, 10);
const playerB = new Player(100, 10, 5);

const arena = new Arena(playerA, playerB);
arena.startMatch();
